# Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant
---
Jarvice (stylised as **JARVIS**) is a Python-based personal voice assistant inspired by Marvel’s Iron Man. It can listen for a wake word, interpret spoken commands, and perform actions such as opening Windows apps, searching the web, playing music on Spotify or YouTube, sending WhatsApp messages or e-mails, and answering general questions using the OpenAI API. It targets Windows and uses speech recognition, text-to-speech, and third-party APIs to provide a hands-free, conversational interface.

## Key Features

* **Wake word + greeting** – listens for “Jarvis”, greets based on time, then awaits commands.
* **Open applications** – launches Google, YouTube, WhatsApp Desktop, Spotify, Calendar, Camera, Netflix, Settings, Weather, and Calculator using their AUMIDs.
* **Web & YouTube search** – extracts queries from speech and opens the right results page (Google or YouTube).
* **Media playback**

  * Understands “play \<song> (by \<artist>) on Spotify”; extracts song/artist with OpenAI and plays via Spotipy.
  * Plays YouTube videos via `pywhatkit`.
  * Supports pause/resume of Spotify playback.
* **Messaging & e-mail**

  * Sends WhatsApp messages using a CSV contacts file (`pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg`), scheduling at the next minute.
  * Sends e-mails via Gmail SMTP after asking for recipient, subject, and body; credentials come from environment variables.
* **General Q\&A** – for other prompts, generates a Jarvis-style response with OpenAI.
* **Exit & shutdown** – “Jarvis rest” exits; “Jarvis shutdown” powers off the PC after a 10-second warning.

## Project Structure

* [`main.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/main.py) – entry point; listens for the wake word, parses speech, and delegates actions (launching apps, searching, media).
* [`Utility.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/Utility.py) – helpers for greeting, listening to mic audio, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech.
* [`openai_integration.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/openai_integration.py) – wraps OpenAI to:

  * answer general questions in a Jarvis tone, and
  * extract song and artist names from free-form commands.
* [`whatsapp_and_mail_integration.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/whatsapp_and_mail_integration.py) – reads contacts CSV, sends WhatsApp messages, validates e-mail addresses, and sends e-mails via SMTP.
* [`spotifyplay_main.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/spotifyplay_main.py) – authenticates with Spotify (Spotipy), ensures the app is running, and plays/pauses/resumes tracks.

## Requirements

Python **3.8+** and these major packages (install individually; no `requirements.txt` bundled):

* `SpeechRecognition`, `pyaudio` – microphone capture & speech recognition
* `pyttsx3` – offline TTS used by [`Utility.speak()`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/Utility.py#L63-L67)
* `gTTS`, `playsound` – alternative TTS routine (currently commented in [`main.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/main.py#L14-L20))
* `pywhatkit` – WhatsApp messages, shutdown, YouTube play
* `spotipy` – Spotify Web API integration ([`spotifyplay_main.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/spotifyplay_main.py))

* Built-ins: `smtplib`, `email.mime`, `datetime`, `subprocess`, `os`

> Windows users may need a prebuilt **PyAudio** wheel; some systems require installing PortAudio.

## Environment Variables

Set these before running:

* `openai_api_key` – OpenAI API key for answers & extracting song info ([`openai_integration.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/openai_integration.py#L4))

## Usage Examples

* “**Jarvis, open Google**” – opens `google.com`
* “**Jarvis, search for cats on YouTube**” – opens YouTube results for *cats*
* “**Jarvis, play Blinding Lights by The Weeknd on Spotify**” – extracts song & artist and plays via Spotipy ([`openai_integration.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/openai_integration.py), [`spotifyplay_main.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/spotifyplay_main.py))
* “**Jarvis, send a message**” – asks whom and what to send, then sends a WhatsApp message ([`whatsapp_and_mail_integration.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/whatsapp_and_mail_integration.py))

* “**Jarvis, rest**” – exits gracefully ([`main.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/main.py))

## Notes

* **Platform** – Focused on **Windows**; uses AUMIDs (`explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder\...`) to open UWP apps. For macOS/Linux, adapt the `open_app` logic in [`main.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/main.py#L21-L33).
* **Contacts file** – The example path is hard-coded in [`main.py`](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Jarvice-Personal-Voice-Assistant/blob/8dbb6bc20c2d1c9031b4ca08fad2db941e1317d8/main.py#L70-L73,L139-L141) for demonstration; change it to your CSV path or extend the code to load dynamically.
* **Secrets** – Never commit keys/passwords. Prefer environment variables (or a secrets manager).

## Contributing
